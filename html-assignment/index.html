        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Chinurum Omenuko. I am 21 years old and i'm from Nigeria. I am a current student at Algonquin College in the Interactive Media Design Program. I've been in Canada since i was 15 years old and so far it has been a very interesting experience. Ive been able to meet various people from all walks of life, eat food from different cultures and places and have my mind open to new ideas</p>

        <p>I am very interested in programming, especially web development. Ive bee around computers since i was little and have always been fascinated with how the software aspects function and interact with each other. Recently, i have learned to also appreciate the visual design side of software thus my choice to enroll in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. My other hobbies are cooking tasty meals, watching football (<em>soccer</em>) with my friends, playing chess, learning to play istruments and taking pics.</p>

Yet at the 101<sup>st</sup> blow it will split in two, and I know it was not the last blow that did it, but all that had gone before." - <cite>Jacob Riis</cite></blockquote>
